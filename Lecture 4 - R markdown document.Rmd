# How to write an R markdown document

In an R markdown document, you can have a normal text (written using markdown), code blocks, output blocks, embedded pictures (even animgifs ;). 

Use standard r markdown notation:

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5


You can draw a horizontal separator like this:

***
Plain text: Plain text  
End lines with two spaces to start a new paragraph  
Bold: *italic*  
Italic: **bold**  
Strike-through: ~~strike-through~~  

Use bullet points:

* like this
* or this
* or his
* or this
    + You
    + can

Or numbering:

1. First
2. Second
3. Third
    a. can
    b. have
    c. hierarchies
    
***
endash: --  
emdash: ---  
ellipsis: ...  
Inline equation: $P(Y) = \frac{1}{1-e^{(B_1X+B_0)}}$

***  

There are some useful keyboard shortcuts:

* Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + K Saves your document and compiles it to html (or pdf or docx, depending on your setting)
* F7 performs a spell check on the text (not the code)
* If you just want to run a code chunk, use Ctrl/Cmd + Enter

## What is more, you can make DYW tables if you must

Title  | T2    |   T3  |    T4
-------|-------|-------|-----------
   This| looks |pretty | oldschoool
But    | still |cool   | imho
       |       |       |

# Code chunks (invisible)
The code chunk looks like the following, if you don't want it to be seen, only executed

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
if (!require(babynames)) install.packages("babynames")
library(babynames)
library(broom)
library(stargazer)
```

# Code chunk (output only)
If you simply print a dataframe, it will be printed interactively.

```{r echo=FALSE}
babynames
```

# Code chunk (code + output)
You can choose to suppress or show outputs, messages, warnings, etc. You can also name your chunks.

```{r transform, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
bertha <- 
    babynames %>% 
    filter(name == "Bertha") 
bertha
```

# Inserting a plot  
Let's make a plot now. We can even change the dimensions of the plot, and align it to the center.

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.height=6, fig.width=9, fig.align = "center"}
bertha %>% 
    ggplot() +
    aes(x = year, y = prop, group = sex, color = sex) +
    geom_line()
```

# Inserting an analysis output  
Let's check model fit indices and parameters

```{r}
bert_mod <- lm(prop*100 ~ year * sex, data = bertha)
broom::tidy(bert_mod)
broom::glance(bert_mod)
```

# Showing a summary table that that is created as html. 
Mind the "asis" parameter of the chunk!
```{r, results='asis'}
stargazer(bert_mod, type = "html", title = "Model summary")
```
